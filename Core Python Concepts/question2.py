# Practical Example 1: How does the Python code structure work

for condition in Python, including indentation and nested blocks..
# Define a condition and a nested condition
    condition = True
    nested_condition = True
    # Indentation is crucial in Python to define blocks of code


if condition:
    # This code is inside the if block
    print("Condition is true")
    if nested_condition:
        # Nested block with additional indentation
        print("Nested condition")
else:
    # Back to the same level as the if
    print("Condition is false")
